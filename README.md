Deepfake image detection project for CS523


Download dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces

# How it works:

1. Save the dataset under the same directory as the jupyter notebook files. Under this dataset there should
   be 3 different dir named `train/`, `valid/`, and `test/`. If you don't want to make changes to the path 
   in the jupyter notebook file, you can name the dataset `140K-data/` and make sure the path to `train/`, 
   `valid/`, and `test/` is called 

2. uncomment the save module cell and run the notebooks to train and save modules

3. run cells below train with different modules to predict the model and get accuracy and results

*The trained modules can be used to predict if an image is handles by GANs(fake in an other word)!*
