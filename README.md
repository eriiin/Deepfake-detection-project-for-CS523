Deepfake image detection project for CS523


Download dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces

# How it works:

1.Save the dataset under the same directory as the jupyter notebook files

2.uncomment the save module cell and run the notebooks to train and save modules

3.run cells below train with different modules to predict the model and get accuracy and results

The trained models can be used to predict if an image is handles by GANs(fake in an other word)!
